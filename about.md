I'm here to talk about start-ups, technology and future trends. We live in one of the most exciting times in human history on the verge of a science and technology revolution that will change the face of our world for ever, and over and over again. 

I am very excited to have the opportuntiy to be a part of this movement hopefully for the next 20-30 years building products and services that add real utility and value improving people's lives in our own small way.
